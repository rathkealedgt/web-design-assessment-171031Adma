                Why was this website created?
            </p1>
            <p>
                This website was created to increase the awareness of global warming and possible solutions to the problem itself. I have linked valuable websites in the sidebar to see what you can do to save our planet. I am incredibly scared of what my potential children's future is, so I decided to do my part and spread awareness.

                Do I have to pay to help?
            </p1>
            <p>
                No, not at all. In fact, one of the biggest contributions you can take is instead of buying plastic bags when you go grocery shopping, bring reusable bags instead. This small change can help. Recycling is incredibly important as well, so do that, and you will be saving your planet.

                How do I prove that global warming exists?
            </p1>
            <p>
                I suggest showing them facts and statistics. I recommend this website:<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/" target="_blank">Nasa Evidence</a>.
